## TABLE OF CONTENTS

### PART 0: QUICK START (2 pages)
*"I have 10 minutes. What's the absolute minimum to start?"*

**0.1 The 3-Sentence Version**
**0.2 The One Thing To Do Today**
**0.3 When to Read the Rest**

**Estimate:** 2 pages, 5 min read

---

### PART I: WEEK 1 — BASELINE & SETUP (8 pages)
*"First week onboarding: measure current state, pick starting mode"*

#### Monday Morning: The Diagnostic (30 min)

**1.1 Calculate Your Baseline Zc (The Analog Method)**
- Step 1: Count messages (last 7 days, primary channel)
- Step 2: Count active team members
- Step 3: Estimate available hours (realistic, not calendar hours)
- Step 4: Apply the formula (calculator provided)
- Step 5: Plot your zone (visual decision tree)

**Example walkthrough:**
```
Team: 8 people
Messages last week: 420
Available hours per person: 6h/day × 5 days = 30h
Total bandwidth: 8 × 30 × 0.6 (efficiency factor) = 144h effective

Zc = 420 / 144 = 2.9

→ RED ZONE. Start with BLUES immediately.
```

**1.2 The Thermometer Test (Qualitative Backup)**
*"What if I don't trust the numbers?"*

10 yes/no questions. 7+ yes = Red Zone regardless of Zc.

Example questions:
- [ ] Do people apologize for "being behind" on messages?
- [ ] Have you discussed the same topic 3+ times without deciding?
- [ ] Do your best people work nights to catch up?
- [ ] Is your primary channel >100 unread messages on Monday morning?

**1.3 Pick Your Starting Mode**

**Decision Tree:**
```
IF Zc < 0.7 AND team has clear tasks:
  → Start Mode A (Study Hall)

IF Zc < 0.7 AND team needs decision:
  → Start Mode B (GUSH)

IF Zc ≥ 1.0 OR Thermometer = Red:
  → Start Mode C (BLUES) — NOT optional

IF 0.7 ≤ Zc < 1.0:
  → Start Mode A, monitor daily, prepare for BLUES
```

**1.4 Configure Your Tools (45 min)**

**For Slack (or equivalent):**
- Create #mode-status channel
- Create #pulse-updates channel (for BLUES)
- Pin mode indicator message
- Set up simple bot OR manual updates

**For Notion/Docs:**
- Create "Idea Repository" page
- Template for contributions (copy-paste ready)
- Archive structure for decisions

**For Calendar:**
- Block "Protected Time" for Study Hall
- Create GUSH recurring slot (optional, use as needed)

**1.5 The Kickoff Meeting (30 min)**

**Agenda:**
```
0-5 min: Share Zc calculation + zone
5-10 min: Explain chosen starting mode
10-20 min: Walk through templates (show, don't tell)
20-25 min: Assign roles (who facilitates, who tracks)
25-30 min: Set first checkpoint (Friday retrospective)
```

**Anti-pattern warning:** Do NOT turn this into a 2-hour philosophy session.

**Estimate:** 8 pages, 30 min read, 2h implementation

---

### PART II: THE 3 SACRED TEMPLATES (12 pages)
*"Copy-paste these. Use them tomorrow. Modify later."*

#### Template 1: The Pulse (BLUES Mode)

**2.1 What It Is**
One-line status update. NOT a discussion. NOT a request.

**2.2 The Format (Strict)**
```
👤 @username: [🟢🟡🔴] [What you're working on] [Progress %] [ETA or blocker]
```

**2.3 Examples (Good vs Bad)**

**✅ GOOD:**
```
👤 @alice: 🟢 Payment gateway integration 75% done. On track for Friday.
👤 @bob: 🟡 Database research taking longer than expected. Need 2 more days.
👤 @charlie: 🔴 BEACON - Blocked on API access. Need Micro-GUSH with DevOps.
```

**❌ BAD:**
```
👤 @alice: Working on stuff. Making progress I think?
👤 @bob: Database is complicated. Many options. Not sure which to pick. Thoughts?
👤 @charlie: Hey @dave can you help me with that thing we discussed?
```

**Why the bad examples fail:**
- Alice: No specificity (what stuff? how much progress?)
- Bob: Turns pulse into discussion (belongs in GUSH)
- Charlie: Creates interruption (DM should be async question)

**2.4 Pulse Rhythm**

**Daily (High Impedance):** 
- Post time: Same time every day (e.g., 4pm)
- Thread: #pulse-updates
- No responses allowed in thread (strict rule)

**Weekly (Low Impedance):**
- Post time: Friday 3pm
- Same format, longer horizon

**2.5 AI Role in Pulse (Optional)**

If you have AI assistant:
```
Prompt: "Aggregate today's pulses into 3-sentence summary. 
Highlight: (1) Overall progress, (2) Blockers/BEACONs, (3) Merge opportunities."
```

**Manual alternative:** Facilitator does this Friday afternoon.

**2.6 The BEACON Protocol**

🔴 = "I'm blocked, need sync help NOW"

**What happens:**
1. BEACON posted in pulse
2. Facilitator (or AI) sees it within 2h
3. Micro-GUSH scheduled within 24h
4. Micro-GUSH: 15-30 min, just the blocker

**Example resolution:**
```
Monday 4pm: Charlie posts BEACON (API access)
Monday 5pm: Facilitator DMs Charlie + DevOps lead
Tuesday 10am: 20-min Micro-GUSH
Tuesday 10:20am: Charlie unblocked, continues work
```

**Estimate:** 4 pages

---

#### Template 2: Fork Declaration (BHO)

**2.7 What It Is**
"I'm disappearing for N days to work deeply. No interruptions. I'll merge back with results."

**2.8 The Format**
```markdown
# BHO Fork: [Topic Name]

**Forker:** @username
**Start Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Merge Promise:** YYYY-MM-DD (max 7 days recommended)
**Rationale:** [1-2 sentences why this needs isolation]

## Scope
I will explore:
- [Bullet 1]
- [Bullet 2]
- [Bullet 3]

## Out of Scope
I will NOT explore:
- [Boundary 1]
- [Boundary 2]

## Pulse Schedule
[Daily/Every 2 days] at [TIME] in #pulse-updates

## Merge Criteria
This fork is ready to merge when:
[Objective condition, e.g., "Prototype working + benchmark complete"]

## Merge Method
[Micro-GUSH on DATE] OR [Document + async review]
```

**2.9 Real Example**
```markdown
# BHO Fork: PostgreSQL vs MongoDB Evaluation

**Forker:** @marcus
**Start Date:** 2026-02-12
**Merge Promise:** 2026-02-16 (Friday)
**Rationale:** This decision needs deep research, not more opinions. 
I need 4 days of focused benchmarking.

## Scope
I will explore:
- Query performance (read/write benchmarks)
- Schema flexibility for our use case
- Team expertise required
- Migration complexity from current MySQL

## Out of Scope
I will NOT explore:
- NewSQL options (out of scope for this sprint)
- Cloud-hosted solutions (separate decision)

## Pulse Schedule
Daily at 4pm in #pulse-updates

## Merge Criteria
This fork is ready to merge when:
- Benchmark results documented
- 2-page comparison matrix complete
- Cost analysis done

## Merge Method
Micro-GUSH Friday 2pm (30 min) with architecture team
```

**2.10 When NOT to Fork**

❌ Don't fork if:
- Decision is urgent (next 48h) → Use GUSH instead
- You need input from others → That's collaboration, not fork
- It's routine work → Just do it in Study Hall

✅ Fork if:
- High complexity requiring deep focus
- Exploring genuinely uncertain territory
- Team debate is circular (need divergence first)

**2.11 The Merge-Back Protocol**

**Option A: Micro-GUSH (Synchronous)**
- 15-30 min session
- Forker presents findings (5 min)
- Q&A (10 min)
- Decision or next steps (10 min)

**Option B: Document + Async Review**
- Forker writes 1-2 page summary
- Posts in #decisions channel
- 48h for async feedback
- If no major objections → Adopted
- If objections → Schedule GUSH

**Estimate:** 4 pages

---

#### Template 3: GUSH Agenda (Forced Convergence)

**2.12 What It Is**
Time-boxed (45-60 min MAX) session where team MUST produce a decision or deliverable.

**2.13 Pre-GUSH Checklist (24h before)**

**Mandatory pre-work:**
- [ ] Objective defined (single decision to make)
- [ ] Context document shared (2 pages max)
- [ ] All participants confirmed they've read it
- [ ] Facilitator assigned (can be human or AI)
- [ ] Timer set and visible

**If ANY checkbox is unchecked → Postpone GUSH**

**2.14 The 45-Minute Template**
```markdown
# GUSH Session: [Decision Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Duration:** 45 minutes (HARD STOP)
**Participants:** @name1, @name2, @name3
**Facilitator:** @facilitator (or AI)
**Objective:** [Single decision to make]

## Agenda

### 0-5 min: Alignment Check
- Confirm everyone read pre-work
- Restate objective
- Set timer (visible to all)

### 5-15 min: Position A Presentation
- Presenter: @name1
- Format: 5-min pitch (slides optional)
- NO interruptions (questions held for debate)

### 15-25 min: Position B Presentation
- Presenter: @name2
- Format: Same as above

### 25-40 min: Structured Debate
- Round 1 (5 min): Questions for clarity
- Round 2 (5 min): Counter-arguments
- Round 3 (5 min): Synthesis attempts

### 40-45 min: Decision + Documentation
- Method: [Vote / Weighted criteria / Consensus / Facilitator call]
- Document: [Who/What/When/Why]
- Dissenters: "Disagree & Commit" acknowledgment

## Decision Record (Fill during session)

**Chosen Option:** [A / B / Hybrid / Postpone to DATE]

**Rationale:** 
[2-3 sentences explaining WHY]

**Dissenters:**
[Names who disagreed + their "Disagree & Commit" statement]

**Action Items:**
- [ ] @owner: [Task] by [DATE]
- [ ] @owner: [Task] by [DATE]

**Next Checkpoint:**
[When we review this decision]
```

**2.15 Example: SQL vs NoSQL Decision**
```markdown
# GUSH Session: Database Selection for User Service

**Date:** 2026-02-14 14:00
**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Participants:** @alice, @bob, @charlie, @dana, @eve
**Facilitator:** @charlie (neutral)
**Objective:** Choose PostgreSQL OR MongoDB for user service rewrite

## Pre-Work Shared
- Alice's 2-page case for PostgreSQL (shared Feb 13, 2pm)
- Bob's 2-page case for MongoDB (shared Feb 13, 2pm)
- All confirmed read ✅

## Agenda Execution

### 0-5 min: Alignment
✅ Everyone read both docs
✅ Objective clear: Pick ONE, ship by March 1
✅ Timer set, visible on Zoom

### 5-15 min: PostgreSQL Case (Alice)
Key points:
- ACID guarantees critical for user data
- Team already knows SQL
- Strong ecosystem
- Migration path clear

### 15-25 min: MongoDB Case (Bob)
Key points:
- Schema flexibility for evolving user model
- Better performance for read-heavy workload
- JSON-native (matches our API)
- Horizontal scaling easier

### 25-40 min: Debate
Q: What's our read/write ratio? → 80/20 (Bob's point holds)
Q: How critical is ACID? → Very (Alice's point holds)
Counter: PostgreSQL can scale horizontally too (Alice)
Counter: MongoDB has transactions now (Bob)

Synthesis attempt (Charlie): "Both are viable. Criteria?"

### 40-45 min: Decision

**Method:** Weighted criteria vote

| Criteria | Weight | PostgreSQL | MongoDB |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| ACID compliance | 40% | 10 | 7 |
| Performance | 30% | 7 | 9 |
| Team expertise | 20% | 9 | 5 |
| Migration cost | 10% | 8 | 6 |
| **Total** | | **8.5** | **7.3** |

**Chosen Option:** PostgreSQL

**Rationale:** 
ACID compliance is non-negotiable for user data. Performance difference is marginal for our scale. Team expertise reduces risk. We can optimize later if needed.

**Dissenters:**
- Bob: "I disagree with the weighting (performance should be 40%), but I commit to making PostgreSQL work and will lead the optimization effort."

**Action Items:**
- [ ] @alice: Create migration plan by Feb 17
- [ ] @dana: Set up PostgreSQL staging by Feb 18
- [ ] @bob: Lead performance optimization post-launch

**Next Checkpoint:** March 15 (review performance metrics)
```

**2.16 GUSH Anti-Patterns**

❌ **The Endless GUSH:**
- Goes past 60 min
- "Just 5 more minutes..." → NO. Stop. Schedule Part 2.

❌ **The Unprepared GUSH:**
- No pre-work shared
- People read docs during session
- Result: Waste of time

❌ **The Fake GUSH:**
- Decision already made privately
- GUSH is just theater
- Result: Team resentment

❌ **The Multi-Objective GUSH:**
- Trying to decide 3 things in one session
- Result: Decides none well

**Estimate:** 4 pages

### PART III: MODE-SPECIFIC PLAYBOOKS (10 pages)
*"How to operate in each mode, day-by-day"*

#### Mode A: Study Hall Operations

**3.1 When You're In Study Hall**
- Zc < 0.7
- Everyone has clear, independent work
- No urgent decisions pending

**3.2 Daily Rhythm**
```
Monday 9am: Set week's focus
  "This week: Payment gateway. Available async in #payments-thread."

Monday-Friday: Deep work blocks
  - 2-4 hour blocks, notifications OFF
  - Presence signal: "Study Hall mode: [topic]. Back at [time]."

Friday 4pm: Week summary
  "Payment gateway: 80% done. One blocker (API docs unclear). Will finish Monday."
```

**3.3 Interruption Protocol**

**If you NEED someone's attention:**
1. Check: Is it urgent? (Can it wait 2h? If yes, wait.)
2. Post in relevant thread (NOT DM unless private)
3. Use async format: "Question about X: [context]. No rush, respond when you surface."

**If someone interrupts YOU:**
1. Acknowledge: "Saw this. Will respond by [TIME]."
2. Finish your focus block
3. Respond thoughtfully

**3.4 AI Usage in Study Hall**

**✅ Good uses:**
- Private research conversations (Claude helping you understand OAuth)
- Draft generation (AI writes first pass, you edit)
- Code review (AI spots bugs you might miss)

**❌ Bad uses:**
- AI generates content you broadcast without review (increases team Zc)
- AI answers team questions (humans lose context)

**Golden Rule:** AI helps YOU work faster. It doesn't broadcast for you.

**Estimate:** 3 pages

---

#### Mode B: GUSH Operations

**3.5 When You Need GUSH**
- Decision required in <5 days
- Discussion has become circular
- Stakeholders aligned on urgency

**3.6 GUSH Scheduling**

**Lead time:** 24-48h minimum
**Frequency:** Max 2 per week (more = you're in wrong mode)

**3.7 The 24h Pre-Work Rule**

**Strict:** If someone hasn't read pre-work, they can't participate.

**How to enforce:**
```
23h before GUSH: "Reply ✅ when you've read the pre-work."

2h before GUSH: Check responses.
  - If <80% confirmed → Postpone
  - No exceptions (even for executives)
```

**Why this matters:** Cold-start GUSH sessions waste 30 min on context-setting.

**3.8 Post-GUSH Protocol**

**Within 2h:** Decision Record posted in #decisions
**Within 24h:** Action items assigned in project tracker
**Within 1 week:** First checkpoint on execution

**Estimate:** 3 pages

---

#### Mode C: BLUES Operations

**3.9 When You MUST Use BLUES**
- Zc ≥ 1.0 (mandatory, not optional)
- Team feels overwhelmed
- 3+ people working on loosely coupled problems

**3.10 BLUES Activation**

**Who can call BLUES:** ANYONE (democratic)

**How to activate:**
```
@channel: "BLUES MODE - Zc is 1.3 (red zone). 
Switching to asynchronous rhythm. 
Pulse updates daily at 4pm in #pulse-updates.
GUSH sessions paused unless BEACON."
```

**What happens immediately:**
1. All scheduled meetings canceled (except BEACONs)
2. Slack notifications → Do Not Disturb by default
3. Focus time blocks expanded (4-6h recommended)
4. Daily pulse becomes mandatory

**3.11 Living in BLUES (Day-to-Day)**

**Morning (9am):**
- Check overnight pulses (5 min)
- Identify your focus for today
- Post intent: "Today: [focus area]"

**Afternoon (4pm):**
- Post pulse (use template)
- Check for BEACONs
- Respond to critical async questions only

**Evening:**
- NO work review (protect boundaries)
- Trust system will converge

**3.12 Exiting BLUES**

**Criteria:**
- Zc drops below 0.8 for 3 consecutive days
- Team votes (simple majority)

**How to exit:**
```
@channel: "Zc now 0.7 (green zone). 
Exiting BLUES mode. 
Returning to Study Hall / GUSH as needed."
```

**Estimate:** 4 pages

---

### PART IV: MEASUREMENT & CALIBRATION (6 pages)
*"How to actually measure Zc without a PhD in statistics"*

#### The Pragmatic Zc Calculator

**4.1 The 5-Minute Method (Weekly)**

**Step 1: Count info generation**
```
Messages sent (primary channel): [number]
Docs created: [number] × 10 (weight docs heavier)
Meetings held: [number] × 5 (meetings generate ideas)

V_gen = messages + (docs × 10) + (meetings × 5)
```

**Step 2: Count processing bandwidth**
```
Team size: [N people]
Hours available per person: [H hours/week]
Efficiency factor: 0.6 (conservative, accounts for slack)

B_soc = N × H × 0.6
```

**Step 3: Calculate**
```
Zc = V_gen / B_soc
```

**Step 4: Interpret**
```
Zc < 0.7 → GREEN
0.7 ≤ Zc < 1.0 → YELLOW
Zc ≥ 1.0 → RED
```

**4.2 The Qualitative Backup (The "Feel" Test)**

**When numbers lie (or you don't trust them):**

Answer honestly (yes/no):
1. Did anyone apologize for "being behind" this week?
2. Did a decision discussion repeat without resolving?
3. Are there 50+ unread messages on Monday morning?
4. Did someone work weekend to catch up?
5. Did a junior person stop asking questions?

**Scoring:**
- 0-1 yes → Probably green
- 2-3 yes → Probably yellow
- 4+ yes → Definitely red

**4.3 Calibration Over Time**

**First month:** Use both methods (quantitative + qualitative)
**After month 1:** You'll develop intuition
**After month 3:** The numbers validate your intuition

**Example calibration log:**
```
Week 1: Zc = 0.9, Feel = Yellow → Aligned ✅
Week 2: Zc = 0.6, Feel = Red → Misaligned ❌
  → Investigation: Turnover (2 people out) → Bandwidth drop not captured
  → Adjust: Factor in sick days, vacations
Week 3: Zc = 1.1, Feel = Red → Aligned ✅
```

**4.4 Automated Tracking (Optional)**

**If you have Slack API access:**
```python
# Pseudo-code for weekly Zc calculation
messages_count = slack_api.get_message_count(channel='#general', days=7)
team_size = slack_api.get_active_users(days=7)
hours_per_person = 30  # 6h/day × 5 days

V_gen = messages_count
B_soc = team_size * hours_per_person * 0.6
Zc = V_gen / B_soc

if Zc >= 1.0:
    slack_api.post_message("#mode-status", "⚠️ Zc = {Zc:.1f} (RED). Consider BLUES mode.")
```

**4.5 Common Measurement Mistakes**

❌ **Mistake 1:** Counting lurkers as active (inflates B_soc)
**Fix:** Only count people who posted ≥1 message/week

❌ **Mistake 2:** Ignoring DMs (underestimates V_gen)
**Fix:** Sample 3 people, estimate DM volume, extrapolate

❌ **Mistake 3:** Assuming 40h/week availability
**Fix:** Use realistic 25-30h (accounts for meetings, interruptions)

**Estimate:** 6 pages

---

### PART V: TROUBLESHOOTING (5 pages)
*"When things break, here's how to fix them"*

#### Common Failure Modes

**5.1 "Nobody wants to declare BHO"**

**Symptom:** Everyone talks about forking, nobody actually does it.

**Root causes:**
1. Cultural: "Going dark" seen as abandoning team
2. Fear: What if I come back with nothing?
3. Confusion: Unclear when to fork vs when to collaborate

**Fixes:**
- **Lead by example:** Team lead declares first BHO, celebrates completion
- **Reframe:** "BHO = protected deep work, not isolation"
- **Set expectations:** "3 days of focus beats 3 weeks of fragmented effort"

**5.2 "GUSH sessions always run over"**

**Symptom:** Every GUSH goes 60+ minutes.

**Root causes:**
1. No pre-work (cold start)
2. Objective unclear (trying to decide 3 things)
3. Facilitator too passive (lets discussion drift)

**Fixes:**
- **Hard timer:** Non-negotiable. At 45min, stop mid-sentence.
- **Pre-work enforcement:** No read = no participate
- **Parking lot:** "Great point, but out of scope. Note for later."

**5.3 "Pulse updates get ignored"**

**Symptom:** People post pulses, nobody reads them.

**Root causes:**
1. Too frequent (pulse fatigue)
2. Too long (people write paragraphs)
3. No aggregation (10 separate messages vs 1 digest)

**Fixes:**
- **Reduce frequency:** Daily → every 2 days OR weekly
- **Enforce format:** Reject non-compliant pulses (sounds harsh, works)
- **AI/human aggregation:** One digest at 5pm, not 10 individual messages

**5.4 "AI summaries are useless"**

**Symptom:** AI generates long, generic summaries nobody reads.

**Root causes:**
1. Wrong prompt (no constraints)
2. No human review (AI outputs broadcast raw)
3. AI trained on wrong corpus (generic, not domain-specific)

**Fixes:**
- **Golden Prompt:** "Max 5 bullets, 2-min read, action items at top, conversational tone"
- **Human edit:** AI generates draft, human refines before sharing
- **Feedback loop:** Weekly review of AI outputs, rate quality, adjust prompts

**5.5 "Team is in different modes simultaneously"**

**Symptom:** Alice in Study Hall, Bob in GUSH, Charlie in BLUES.

**This is OKAY if:**
- Different projects/streams
- Clear boundaries (not working on same thing)

**This is PROBLEM if:**
- Same project, conflicting expectations
- Example: Alice expects sync meeting, Bob is deep in fork

**Fix:**
- **Project-level modes:** "Project X is in BLUES, Project Y is in Study Hall"
- **Explicit handoffs:** "I'm exiting Study Hall for this topic, entering GUSH"

**Estimate:** 5 pages

---

### PART VI: ADVANCED TOPICS (4 pages)
*"For teams who've mastered the basics"*

#### Multi-Team Coordination

**6.1 When You Have 3+ Teams**

**Challenge:** Team A in Study Hall, Team B in BLUES, Team C in GUSH.

**Solution: Interface Protocol**
- Teams operate independently internally
- Cross-team interaction via scheduled bridges (weekly sync)
- Each team sends representative (rotates)

**6.2 Nested BHO**

**What it is:** Fork within a fork.

**Example:**
- Team declares BHO on "New architecture design" (7 days)
- Within that, Alice declares sub-BHO on "Database layer" (3 days)

**When to use:** Highly complex problems requiring sub-specialization.

**Rule:** Max 2 levels of nesting (prevents getting lost).

#### The Async-First Organization

**6.3 Remote Teams (Different Timezones)**

**Challenge:** Synchronous GUSH is painful when team spans 12 timezones.

**Solution:**
- **Async GUSH:** 48h decision window instead of 45min meeting
  - Pre-work shared Day 1
  - Structured async debate Day 1-2
  - Decision recorded Day 2 EOD
  - Works when decision isn't ultra-urgent

**6.4 Documentation Debt**

**Challenge:** After 6 months, you have 50 fork outcomes, unclear what's current.

**Solution:**
- **Living Index:** One source of truth page
- **Automatic pruning:** Archive forks >90 days old
- **Quarterly review:** Update "Current State of Decisions"

**Estimate:** 4 pages

---

## DECISION POINTS FOR YOU

Before I write the full manual, confirm:

**1. Structure OK?**
- Is this the right progression (Quick Start → Setup → Templates → Operations)?
- Any sections missing that would block real-world use?

**2. Tone Check**
- Sample from 2.9 (Fork example): Does this feel "garage" enough?
- Too much detail in some sections? Too little in others?

**3. Templates Priority**
- Should I expand template examples even more?
- Do you want ACTUAL Notion/Slack screenshots or text-only?

**4. Code Integration**
- Part IV.4 has pseudo-code for Slack automation. Should I:
  - Keep it conceptual (current)
  - Write full working Python
  - Skip entirely (manual-first)

**5. Length Trade-off**
- 45 pages might be too long for "quick start"
- Option A: Write full 45 pages, plus 5-page "Executive Summary"
- Option B: Write lean 25-page version, expand later based on feedback

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION

**Write in phases:**

**Phase 1 (Priority now):**
- Part 0 (Quick Start)
- Part I (Week 1)
- Part II (Templates)
→ ~20 pages, immediately usable

**Phase 2 (After first pilot feedback):**
- Part III (Playbooks)
- Part IV (Measurement)
→ Based on what breaks in real use

**Phase 3 (Once teams are running):**
- Part V (Troubleshooting)
- Part VI (Advanced)

This way you ship something usable in 2-3 days instead of 2 weeks.
