## Template Notes

**When to use GUSH:**
- Zc between 0.7-1.0 (Yellow Zone)
- Multiple decisions pending for >48 hours
- Team expressing decision fatigue

**When NOT to use GUSH:**
- Complex technical decisions needing research
- Legal/compliance decisions
- Decisions requiring external stakeholders
- Creative brainstorming (use The Jam instead)

**Success pattern:**
- Pre-read distributed 24h before
- Hard 90-min time limit
- At least 70% decisions closed
- Immediate action items assigned

---

## Emergency Escape Hatch

If session is failing (30+ min with no decisions):

1. **STOP**
2. Acknowledge: "This isn't working"
3. Convert to BHO declaration session
4. Schedule follow-up GUSH in 72h
5. Assign research owners

*Better to abort early than waste 90 minutes*
