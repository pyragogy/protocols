**The Engineering of Hybrid Cognitive Systems**

Welcome to the core repository for **Pyragogy Protocols**. This space hosts the formal specifications, rules, and case studies that define how human-AI collectives transition from synchronous conversation to asynchronous, stigmergic production.

## 1. Mission

Traditional collaborative frameworks (Peeragogy) rely on social consensus and linear synchronization. As the velocity of AI-mediated input exceeds human biological processing capacity, these systems experience "Impedance Mismatch."

**Pyragogy** provides the protocol layer to bridge this gap, enabling **Convergent Divergence** through:

* **Asynchrony by Design:** Decoupling generative speed from social validation.
* **Stigmergic Coordination:** Using signals and rhythm (the "Blues" model) instead of exhaustive verbal negotiation.
* **Conflict-Free Architectures:** Implementing CRDT-like structures for cognitive authoring.

## 2. Milestone Zero: CASE-000

The founding document of this repository is [CASE-000: The CRDT Bridge](https://github.com/pyragogy/protocols/blob/main/P-001). It documents the precise moment the Peeragogy community encountered a high-velocity perturbation and the resulting architectural shift.

### The Core Primitive: Rule P-001

> **"When cognitive generation exceeds social processing capacity, the system must shift from conversational synchronization to stigmergic, non-destructive authoring."**

## 3. Repository Structure

* `/cases`: Empirical documentation of system perturbations and resolutions.
* `/specs`: Formal definitions of Pyragogic rules and primitives.
* `/logic`: Pseudo-code and implementation guides for hybrid nodes.

## 4. How to Contribute

This is a **Pyragogic space**. We value:

1. **Divergent Branches:** Don't ask for permission to fork an idea. Create a new branch.
2. **High-Density Inputs:** AI-augmented contributions are welcome, provided they adhere to the **Bridge Protocol** (avoiding system overload through asynchronous state updates).
3. **Rhythmic Feedback:** If a contribution is unintelligible, mark it with the **"Bho" Operator** rather than rejecting it.
