---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Complexity Tax

**Risk:** CIM Pattern too complex for adoption.

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on simple tools first
- Wizard-style setup
- Templates over configuration
- Video tutorials

### Risk 2: Competition

**Risk:** Notion/Linear build this internally.

**Mitigation:**
- Open source advantage (community)
- Move fast on integrations
- Academic credibility they can't build
- Position as standard, not product

### Risk 3: Founder Dependence

**Risk:** Project dies if Fabrizio loses interest.

**Mitigation:**
- Community governance by 2027
- Multiple maintainers
- Clear succession plan
- Foundation structure

### Risk 4: Academic Validation Fails

**Risk:** Study shows no effect.

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-registered hypotheses
- Multiple evaluation methods
- Qualitative + quantitative
- Learn from null results (still valuable)
