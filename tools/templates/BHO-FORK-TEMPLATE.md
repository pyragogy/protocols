- [ ] GUSH session (if decision required)

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Final document/prototype
- [ ] Recommendation (clear yes/no/pivot)
- [ ] Next actions
- [ ] Lessons learned

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Meets success criteria defined above
- [ ] Team has 24h to review before merge
- [ ] No major objections during merge

## Lessons Learned (post-merge)

**What worked:**
- ________________________________________________

**What didn't:**
- ________________________________________________

**Would fork again?**
- [ ] Yes - good use of BHO
- [ ] No - should have been GUSH
- [ ] Maybe - depends on [condition]

**Actual time spent:** ___ hours  
**Zc impact:** Reduced by ___%

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Fork without clear merge date** → Becomes zombie work  
❌ **Too many people in fork** → Recreates the original problem  
❌ **No communication protocol** → Main channel gets polluted  
❌ **Scope creep during fork** → Never-ending divergence  
❌ **Merging without review time** → Decisions forced on team

✅ **Good fork:** Single owner, clear scope, hard deadline, clean merge  
✅ **Bad fork:** Committee, vague goal, "when done", surprise merge

---

## Quick Reference

**When to BHO:**
- Zc > 1.0 (Red Zone)
- Decision needs deep research
- Creative work requiring flow state
- Can be done by 1-3 people

**When NOT to BHO:**
- Simple decision (use GUSH)
- Requires entire team input
- Time-sensitive (<48h)
- Already have enough forks open

**Healthy fork count:** 
- Team of 5-10: Max 2 concurrent forks
- Team of 10-20: Max 4 concurrent forks
